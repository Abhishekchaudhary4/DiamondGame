- Decks:
  - Diamonds suit acts as auction cards (13 diamond cards: A(1) through K(13)).
  - Each other suit (Hearts, Clubs, Spades) is assigned as the hand for one player.

- Setup:
  - 1â€“3 players allowed. Each player receives one full suit (13 cards).
  - Shuffle the diamonds deck and reveal one diamond per round.

- Round:
  - Reveal a diamond card (value = its rank).
  - Each player selects one card from their suit (face value = rank; A=1, J=11, Q=12, K=13).
  - The highest played rank wins the diamond and gets points equal to the diamond's rank.
  - If multiple players tie for the highest rank, they split the diamond's points equally.

- Scoring:
  - Points from diamonds are added to player's score.
  - After 13 rounds, the player with the highest total score wins.

- Notes:
  - Players can't see opponents' hands (unless explicitly allowed in reveal modes).
  - Bots implement different heuristics; experiments pit them to evaluate strategies.
